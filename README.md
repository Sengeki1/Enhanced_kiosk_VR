## Future Applications of VR in Pre-Construction Visualization  
VR technology like **Enhanced Kiosk VR** could be highly beneficial for **architectural visualization and pre-construction experiences**. Imagine:

- **Showing new building designs** to potential investors, allowing them to **walk through** the space before it is even built.  
- **Helping politicians or city planners** experience the impact of a new community center, school, or infrastructure project before committing resources.  
- **Allowing families to explore a new home** before purchasing, adjusting interior design choices in real time.  
- **Retail stores** previewing their layouts before construction, optimizing the customer experience.
